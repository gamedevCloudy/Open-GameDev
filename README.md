## Intro
I am creating this list on the occasion of my birthday.
[![B'day](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=B'Day&message=03/10&color=blueviolet)]()&#160; 
I wish that this helps anyone and everyone wishing to get started with Game Development and continue ahead.  
This list was inspired from [Ebook Foundation - Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books#readme)
